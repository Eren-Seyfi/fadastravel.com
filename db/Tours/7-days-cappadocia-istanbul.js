        "The hospitality, the views, and the experiences are all beyond words. Our accommodations in both cities were exceptional. Especially in Cappadocia the attention we had from Makbule was something else. Our rooms in Istanbul were great as well. Breakfast was amazing in both cities (definitely a highlight of our tour). And the restaurant in Istanbul was perfect for our family. The day tours brought history to life, and the hot air balloon ride in Cappadocia was like a fairy tale. Already recommended this trip to my friends.",

        "Our 7-day exploration of Cappadocia and Istanbul was as high quality as it gets. I turned my brain off the entire trip and everything was just arranged for us. My single point of contact was Ms. Makbule (making it really easy for me) and accommodations in both cities were luxurious, and the tours were beautiful. All the tour guides, staff, and everyone we met had a big smile and were happy to help. Meeting Makbule and Seckin in person was also amazing - they truly care for every single guest. I say that genuinely. The saddest part is I am writing this on the plane back home and I don’t know how I am going to go back to work after this amazing getaway.",

        "The accommodations are charming and cozy, and the staff's hospitality is heartwarming. Ms. Makbule operates the hotel in Cappadocia, so she gave me extra attention - anything I needed from juice, water, to coffee (even outside breakfast hours) was provided. Our guided tours were also very fun. The hot air balloon experience is simply magical - I recommend everyone to try it at least once in their life. Istanbul didn’t fall short either. I landed and the driver was waiting with my name card and took me straight to my hotel in the old city. The hotel was also super close to all the main spots. I can’t rate this tour enough and will come back to Turkey again!",

The hot air balloon ride with the sunrise was surreal. Istanbul's energy left me with unforgettable memories. Our guides in both cities were all very cheerful and our groups were very energetic. The Bosphorus tour literally left me speechless. I can't thank Makbule and her team enough for this adventure.",

She gave us a real insight and knowledge of our trip, recommended the best spots to eat, places to explore in our free time. All of our accommodations and activities were also fantastic. Overall I have no complaints - would do it again.",

Our Cappadocia hotel had sights of panoramic balloon views and the home-cooked breakfasts in both cities were incredible. The tours were very informing and our guide Ahmet in Istanbul was hilarious. Istanbul's charm and rich culture are something I recommend everyone to experience. I'm already planning a return trip because this one set the bar incredibly high.",

The hot air balloon ride, a dream come true. Istanbul was also beautiful. Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque were just a 7-8 minute walk from the hotel, and Ahmet our tour guide was amazing. This experience was wonderful.",

Cappadocia especially (Makbule operates the hotel). Our tour guides in both cities were always smiling. I can't express how perfect this trip was. I've already spread the word to friends, and you should absolutely book it too.",

        "There is so much to talk about. Starting with Cappadocia. I was greeted by my driver as soon as I stepped outside the airport and taken to the hotel. Mak’s Cave House - their hotel is fantastic. Every room was designed to detail and color-coded. My morning breakfasts were amazing too and I did the hot air balloon ride for the first time (highly recommend it). Mak and her staff always there and anything I needed from a bandaid to dinner service to the hotel they arranged it. My tour in Cappadocia and the Turkish night was also really nice. On the 4th day I was taken to the airport again and flew to Istanbul. There another driver waiting with a name card for me. My hotel in Istanbul (Garden House Hotel) also amazing, staff were very good, and the Turkish food was wow. The group tours were very fun with Ahmet (incredible tour guide) always making us laugh.",

        "Truly exceeded my expectations. First of all I want to thank everyone I came in contact with. There are too many names, the staff members at every hotel, our tour guides, and of course Makbule and Seckin. Everyone was spectacular! The airport transfers in Mercedes cars made everything very easy. The hotels, Mak’s Cave House and Akra Hotel, were pure luxury. We enjoyed the Turkish Night Show in Cappadocia a lot! The Istanbul guided tours of the Old City and Bosphorus Cruise were excellent. Our hotel in Istanbul also had an amazing restaurant and dinners there were great. And for one of the nights we decided to do the Private Yacht Dinner in the Bosphorus. It was a special moment to say the least, seeing the sunset while eating dinner in the Bosphorus. I am so glad we arranged this trip.",

This was a relaxing holiday and an amazing educational experience all at once. Makbule also was just a text message away if we ever needed assistance. Meeting her in person at Cappadocia was also very comforting. Everything was very high quality like advertised and the transportation was stress free. I am glad to have done this tour.",

Makbule who actually runs the Cappadocia hotel (Mak’s Cave House) was incredible to us and was in constant communication to make sure everything was going according to plan. All hotels were Premium as described and all had amazing breakfasts (And the hotel restaurant in Istanbul is a great option for dinner). Our hotel in Antalya had the most amazing sea view. I still can’t stop thinking about it! Also the private tour in Antalya with our guide Elif was top notch- she is amazing and gave us a deep understanding of the city. If you want to travel to Turkey this tour is a perfect option.",

We met them in Cappadocia at their hotel and realized we made the best choice by choosing this trip. They looked after our tour with care and compassion. Each city we visited had its own unique characteristic. Cappadoccia- Fairy Chimneys, Antalya- The Mediterranean Sea, Pamukkale- Cotton Castles and Hierapolis, Istanbul-The Bosphorous. The trip was very organized and Makbule kept us informed on what to expect throughout our travels. Everything was on time and I was very happy with the quality of service.",

The transfers, accommodations, and activities in Cappadocia, Antalya, Istanbul was simply put - AMAZING. The accommodations at Mak’s Cave House in Cappadocia was the highlight for me personally. Hot Air Balloons flying over you with amazing views. And that breakfast. I drool just thinking about it. It’s been two weeks since I returned home and I already want to come back!",

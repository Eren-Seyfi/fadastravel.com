        "From the moment we stepped off the plane to the final farewell, this trip was premium. Our transportation was perfectly arranged with no delays, and Makbule was in constant contact with me to make sure everything was ok. The hotel is in a good location, walking distance to major attractions in the old town, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, etc.. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a lovely terrace looking into the inner courtyard. Breakfast was also fabulous. Our tours were amazing, and our guides Mehmet and Ali were always cheerful. Thank you for the amazing time!",

Everyone in the family really enjoyed the Bosphorus Cruise Tour and it was definitely the highlight for us. The location of our hotel was very good has an amazing restaurant including great breakfast. Also the service is very fast and staff is really helpful. The overall vibe is great and is 5 mins from blue mosque. I don’t have any complaints for the entire tour, highly recommend Fadas to anyone that wants to see Turkey!",

Mehmet, our guide in the Old City Walking Tour really tried- I want to give a special shout out to him. Makbule's team was also always just a call away, making sure everything was perfect. They were the best! I am so glad I saw their offer.",

My husband and I never worried about anything - out entire trip was planned out. The hotel was also a true gem, and everyone was always so kind and made sure we were satisfied. It was cozy and clean and the staff was really welcoming. On our arrival in the early morning we were received by Omer, who was always nice and smiling. Our tour guide Mehmet was also so hilarious and we are going to miss him! Thank you for this amazing experience!",

They were more than educational; they were history in front of my eyes. The hotel also had a fantastic location right in the middle of town, just 5 mins to the major attractions. For us (2 adults and 3 children) this tour was also very comfortable. I didn’t worry about the transportation and logistics like I usually do on our family trips. I thank everyone who helped me on this tour, and hope to travel to Istanbul again!",

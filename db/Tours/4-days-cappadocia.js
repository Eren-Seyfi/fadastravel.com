        "I think the question should be is there anything we didn’t like about the tour and I would say “not a thing”. We loved everything starting from location, activities, convenience, professionalism, exceptional breakfast, and most importantly the personal care and hospitality. Even Though I was in Cappadocia (a city I never been to before), it still felt like home. The owners of the company and hotel, Mak and Seckin are the best hosts we have come across. They spent their personal time to sit with us and explain the tours etc, the fresh pancakes and jam their Mak’s mum makes, these little details brought warmth and inspiration. Naturally so kind and so genuine. The beautiful smiles and efficiency from the staff was remarkable. Highly recommended especially the fact you can have the home made breakfast at any time convenient to you. All of our transfers were conveniently arranged as well and in comfortable vehicles. Loved that personalization. Thank you for this unforgettable experience. My mum and I are forever grateful for all the love and care. We will be back for sure.",

        "If you plan on visiting Cappadocia go with Fadas. Because they will plan everything for you! The hospitality is outstanding, going above and beyond to ensure your experience is a one you’ll always remember. Accommodation is beautiful with marble and stone structure and the rooms are comfortable and spacious (and feel very authentic to the area). Staff are on hand to offer advice and help explain day trips, hot air balloon rides and the Turkish dinner night. The views of Cappadocia from their roof terrace are second to none and feel secluded, like your own private rooftop. This is one of the best packages we have ever done and I will be returning in the future. Also the breakfast is fit for a Sultan.",

We arrived at about 1 am and they received us super friendly and without any inconvenience. Makbule owns the hotel and are amazing, attentive and very friendly. The girls at the reception are also amazing, always available for any questions! There are no words to describe breakfast! it was delicious and plentiful so no chance to be left hungry! It is a tour where you are going to feel super welcomed since it is a very personalized treatment.",

The boy who works at night doesn’t speak English, but he will try his best to help you. He offered us tea/ coffee while we were watching balloons on the rooftop in the early morning and made sure we got to our tours on time. Lovely Experience!",

        "Not enough words to describe this trip with Fadas Travel. I have traveled many countries, stayed in many hotels and never in any so special. The Vip pick up made everything so easy. The hotel is amazing! Each bedroom has a different style, based on the color of some floor. The fireplace, the lighting, the temperature, everything. Spectacular. (I repeat, even the smallest detail is taken care of) The super comfortable bed, as well as everything as a whole. When someone does their job with love, it shows. The breakfast, spectacular. The views, unbeatable. There is an energy that makes you disconnect from the world. And about the treatment received... Eternally grateful. I felt literally at home.(Or better!) They helped me with everything not included as well, balloon bookings, dinner orders, everything. Making it so comfortable and easy for me. I found a peace and quiet that filled me with happiness. Choosing this trip definitely made my stay in Cappadocia unforgettable. I can only recommend with all my heart this trip and this family to whom I wish to see again very soon.",

Mak herself was always at hand and special mention for Ali, the night manager. We had breakfast at 6 am due to early flight… and they still arranged it. Tea, coffee, juice were available free of cost at any time. Also 5 star for the carrot cake.. the signature dish of Mak’s mother. The views on our tours and hotel were incredible and panoramic. I joined a horseback tour and highly recommend that! Overall great experience in Cappadocia.",

The accommodation was great with amazing views of the town, amazing sunrise views and great visibility of the hot air balloons. We did a hot air balloon tour too. It was magical! The breakfast was homemade and absolutely delicious. The attention to detail was exquisite and they made sure I have plenty of options as a vegan. Our Cappadocia Tour was also well organized and our tour guide Mehmet was very experienced. Didn’t have any problems during the whole trip!",

What made this tour amazing are the people who work at the hotel/company. All the girls are lovely and especially the owner Ms. Makbule. She is beyond amazing and goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable. Makbule has been so helpful with organizing this trip for us and made sure everything in the itinerary was done to satisfaction. Her input has been very valuable. We truly felt we were part of her family. The people are so warm and always smiling. Well done to the whole team. We really enjoyed our trip.",

We have absolutely no complaints, it is more, just gratitude for all the kindness, delivery, dedication, hospitality and a long time etc. Amazing breakfast, and I have been in 3 different hotels during my stay in Turkey, and definitely the best. The rooms, cared to the maximum detail, perfect location. During the excursions, transportation, they provide you with absolutely everything. In short, one of the best trips where both my girlfriend ever did. Do not hesitate to come, you will not regret it.",

Maximum freshness, variety, huge portions! - The interior is important to me - it is here that it is thought out to the smallest detail (warm floors, fireplace, ventilation, national textiles, freshness and cleanliness of bed linen - 10/10!). My tours were also great, the transportation made it very convenient and the Ahmet, our guide showed us everything he can.
